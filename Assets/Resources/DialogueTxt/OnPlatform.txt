Nice.
Next up we will talk about levels and enemies./
You will be dropped of at a location, or "level", by train at the start of each combat simulation.
These levels will have enemies stationed throughout the enviorment./
Once you have eliminated every enemy the same train that you arrived with will station itself nearby the end of a level./
Teleporting onto it's roof will allow you to proceed to the next level. Remember that you can also exit anytime through the pause menu by pressing -ESC-./
Throughout your tests, we will collect data about your performance with the bow which will be presented to you on each cleared level./
Now, going back to enemies..@/
