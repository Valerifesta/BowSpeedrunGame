As you may already know; 
We have been looking for suitable volunteers to field test our latest prototype-bow in a number of simulated scenarios,
most of which being combat-related./
By participating in this, you will be able to contribute with data that will be essential for it's continued development./
For this, you have the institution's gratitude./
We will now proceed to walk you through the basics of utilizing the prototype, as well as getting used to your current virtual body./
Begin to look around the scene by dragging around your mouse (←↑→↓), see if you can find the red rings.@/
